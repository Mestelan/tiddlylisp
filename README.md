# tiddlylisp

Tiddlylisp is a toy Lisp interpreter, written in Python, and intended
to accompany the essay
[http://michaelnielsen.org/lisp-as-the-maxwells-equations-of-software/](Lisp
as the Maxwell's equations of software).

The repository contains the following files:

`tiddlylisp.py`: A simple interpreter for a subset of Lisp.
Tiddlylisp is adapted from and closely based on Peter Norvig's
[http://norvig.com/lispy.html](lispy interpreter).  

`sqrt.tl`: An example tiddlylisp program, for computing square roots.
Adapted from an example in the book
[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/](The Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs), by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with
Julie Sussmann.

`eval.tl`: A tiddylisp program defining a function `eval` which can
evaluate any Lisp expression, albeit, for an even smaller subset of
Lisp than tiddlylisp.

See
[http://michaelnielsen.org/lisp-as-the-maxwells-equations-of-software/](the
essay) for more details.
